Status
------

NodizeCMS is still under heavy development, there's a ton of unimplemented features and even more bugs.

It's not ready for production yet, but you still can start to play with it and have plenty of fun !

Application stack
-----------------
nodejs >0.6.x

express

zappajs

sequelize

mysql

redis (optional)

Installation 
------------

Installation has been tested under Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Git, MySQL, Node.js and NPM have to be installed

Make a global install of CoffeeScript
```
npm install -g coffee-script
```

Retrieve NodizeCMS
```
git clone git://github.com/nodize/nodizecms.git
```

Install dependencies
```
cd nodizecms

npm install
```

Create a MySQL database and modify the file "/themes/pageone/settings/database.json"
```
mysqladmin create pageone
```

Start the server
```
coffee app.coffee
```

When your database is empty, a default "admin" user will be created with a random password at server startup :
```
._   _           _ _         
| \ | |         | (_)        
|  \| | ___   __| |_ _______ 
| . ` |/ _ \ / _` | |_  / _ \
| |\  | (_) | (_| | |/ /  __/
\_| \_/\___/ \__,_|_/___\___|

listening on port 3000
SuperAdmin group created
Default user created, login = admin, password = 45A90 <----------- YOUR PASSWORD
Default lang created
Default menu created
```

Now you can access to the admistration module, open you browser on "http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin" (replace 127.0.0.1 by your server IP/URL if it's not running on the localhost).

If you're still there and that everything went fine, you should have a nice but empty backend.

Let's load some data :
(replace "pageone" by your database name)
```
mysql pageone < themes/pageone/sql/pages.sql
```
or (if you have some access rights defined in MySQL) :
```
mysql pageone -u root -p < themes/pageone/sql/pages.sql
```

Now refresh your browser ! Do you see pages & articles ? Great ! 

Open a new browser window and enter this URL : "http://127.0.0.1:3000", if you're lucky, you're just looking at a dynamic webpage powered by Node.js & NodizeCMS !
